© The general solution of the ODE is y = sina + C.

«This represents a family of solutions, where different values of C’ shift the curve vertically.

© The graph in Figure 3 shows multiple solution curves corresponding to different values of C,
such as C = —3, -2,—1,0,1,2,3,4.

* Each curve is a shifted version of sin x, meaning the overall shape remains the same but is
displaced vertically depending on C.
Conclusion:
The differential equation y! = cos a was solved by direct integration.
* The solution is a family of sine curves, where each curve differs by a constant shift.

humans for small populations in a large country (e.g., the United States in early times) and is then known as
‘Malthus’s law.? We shall say more about this topic in Sec. 1.5.

y grows.

the rate of increase is proportional to the current size.

zero.

Key Takeaways
© If k > 0, the function grows exponentially.

Radioactivity. Exponential Decay

Given an amount of a radioactive substance, say, 0.5 g (gram), find the amount present at any later time.
Physical Information. Experiments show that at each instant a radioactive substance decomposes—and is thus
decaying in time—proportional to the amount of substance present.

Step 1. Setting up a mathematical model of the physical process. Denote by y(t) the amount of substance still
present at any time f. By the physical law, the time rate of change y'(t) = dy/dr is proportional to y(#). This
gives the first-order ODE

where the constant k is positive, so that, because of the minus, we do get decay (as in [B] of Example 3).
‘The value of k is known from experiments for various radioactive substances (e.g., k = 1.4- 1071! sec},
approximately, for radium 73gRa).

Now the given initial amount is 0.5 g, and we can call the corresponding instant ¢ = 0. Then we have the
initial condition (0) = 0.5. This is the instant at which our observation of the process begins. It motivates
the term initial condition (which, however, is also used when the independent variable is not time or when
we choose af other than t = 0). Hence the mathematical model of the physical process is the initial value
